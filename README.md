# luadbg
Debugger for Lua

This is modified from [clidedebugger](https://github.com/ToddWegner/clidebugger), with only cosmetic changes. I plan to add a few missing features to make it like gdb.

You can also install this as:
``
luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratikac/luadbg/master/luadbg-0.1-1.rockspec
``
